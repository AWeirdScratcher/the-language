## Be Polite

Remember to be polite! You're living in a society where nobody really cares about you, so to emphasize your existence, say "please."

```haskell
please print "Hello, World!"
```

If you afraid that nobody is going to hear you, just speak louder.

```haskell
PLEASE print "Hello, World!"
```
