# The Language

The language is the language of all time. Symbols are very useless in this language.

Key features:
- increase your attention span
- increase code readability
- i18n support<sup>1</sup>

## Be Polite

Remember to be polite! You're living in a society where nobody really cares about you, so to emphasize your existence, say "please." Not saying "please" would raise a 99% chance of crashing when running code.

```haskell
Please print "Hello, World!"
```

<details>
  <summary>
    >_ 
  </summary>
<p>

```
Hello, World!
```

</p>
</details>

> [!NOTE]
> The English grammar is requisite in The Language¬Æ Ecosystem.

If you afraid that nobody is going to hear you, just speak louder.

```haskell
PLEASE print "Hello, World!"
```

## Debugging

Add a question mark (`?`) or prefix with `I'm not sure: <statement>` at the beginning of each statement to print debug info on the terminal.

```haskell
Please print "Hello, World?"
I'm not sure: Please print "Hello, World!"
```

## Migrating from C/C++/Java

Languages like C/C++/Java require a ";" (semi-column) at the end of every statement. The Language¬Æ uses English punctuations instead.

**‚úÖ OK:**

Simple statements:
```python
Statement.
Statement!
Statement?
```

Strings:
```haskell
Please print "Hello, World!"
Please print "Hello, World."
Please print "Hello, World?"
Please print "Hello, World," period.
```

<details>
  <summary>
    >_ 
  </summary>
<p>

```ini
Hello, World!
Hello, World.
Hello, World. [debug‚Ä¶]
Hello, World.
```

</p>
</details>

<br />

**‚ùå Not OK:**

```haskell
Please print "Hello, World!". (<- too many punctuations)
Please print "Hello, World". (<- should be inside)
```

**üò® Scawy:**
```
Please print "Hello, World!"? (<- bad, but passing)
Please print "Hello, World!". (<- remove that period)
```
